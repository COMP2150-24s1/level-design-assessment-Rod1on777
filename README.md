## 1. Player Experience (~700 words)

### 1.1. Discovery

Goal: Lead the player on a journey of discovery, introducing them to the game's mechanics and world naturally and interestingly.
#### Design choices:
Gradual Introduction to Mechanics:  The initial encounter introduces basic mechanics in an isolated area, allowing players to experiment without feeling overwhelmed.  Subsequent encounters 2 and 3 could build on these foundations, introducing novel interactions between previously known mechanics. 

#### Environmental Storytelling:
The gaming world itself can be a teacher.  Environmental riddles, level design that discreetly guides the study, and visual cues provide knowledge without needing written hints.

Safe Experimentation Spaces: My design allows players to put their abilities and new knowledge to the test in a low-risk environment.  This is most noticeable in encounter 1:
Скрин1
If the player fails to jump, he will fall to the platform below, which saves him from falling and losing HP. In addition, this allows the player not only to safely complete this section of the level but also to hone their skills by making 2 jumps, instead of missing one, without rolling back the player’s progress.
Скрин2
The screenshot shows a safe grassy platform, which serves as the player's starting point. The calm environment helps the player relax and familiarize themselves with the movement controls. The first minor obstacle is also presented to the player: a one-block jump, which serves as a quick check to see if he has grasped the basic controls. A closed door on the left indicates the direction from which the player's character came, providing a clear goal for where to proceed next.

The level structure is designed to guide players towards intuitive learning of game mechanics, creating the illusion of self-directed learning without external prompts. By discovering mechanics independently, players experience a sense of accomplishment and ownership over their knowledge. A world that teaches through its design feels more natural and believable.
This approach to discovery through level design fosters a sense of agency and immersion, creating the foundation for a more rewarding and engaging gameplay experience.

### 1.2. Drama
What is the intensity curve? How does your design facilitate increasing yet modulating intensity, with moments of tension and relief? 

### 1.3. Challenge
What are the main challenges? How have you designed and balanced these challenges to control the difficulty curve and keep the player in the flow channel?

### 1.4. Exploration
How does your level design facilitate autonomy and invite the player to explore? How do your aesthetic and layout choices create distinct and memorable spaces and/or places?

## 2. Core Gameplay (~400 words)
A section on Core Gameplay, where storyboards are used to outline how you introduce the player to each of the required gameplay elements in the first section of the game. Storyboards should follow the format provided in lectures.

Storyboards can be combined when multiple mechanics are introduced within a single encounter. Each section should include a sentence or two to briefly justify why you chose to introduce the mechanic/s to the player in that sequence.

You should restructure the headings below to match the order they appear in your level.

### 2.1. Acid

### 2.2. Checkpoints

### 2.3. Chompers

### 2.4. Health Pickups

### 2.5. Keys

### 2.6. Moving Platforms

### 2.7. Passthrough Platforms

### 2.8. Spikes

### 2.9. Spitters

### 2.10. Weapon Pickup (Gun)

### 2.11. Weapon Pickup (Staff)

## 3. Spatiotemporal Design
A section on Spatiotemporal Design, which includes your molecule diagram and annotated level maps (one for each main section of your level). These diagrams may be made digitally or by hand, but must not be created from screenshots of your game. The annotated level maps should show the structure you intend to build, included game elements, and the path the player is expected to take through the level. Examples of these diagrams are included in the level design lectures.

No additional words are necessary for this section (any words should only be within your images/diagrams).
 
### 3.1. Molecule Diagram

### 3.2. Level Map – Section 1

### 3.3.	Level Map – Section 2

### 3.4.	Level Map – Section 3

## 4. Iterative Design (~400 words)
Reflect on how iterative design helped to improve your level. Additional prototypes and design artefacts should be included to demonstrate that you followed an iterative design process (e.g. pictures of paper prototypes, early grey-boxed maps, additional storyboards of later gameplay sequences, etc.). You can also use this section to justify design changes made in Unity after you drew your level design maps shown in section 3. 

You should conclude by highlighting a specific example of an encounter, or another aspect of your level design, that could be improved through further iterative design.

### Tool Used: ChatGPT
**Nature of Use** Finding relevant design theory.

**Evidence Attached?** Screenshot of ChatGPT conversation included in the folder "GenAI" in this repo.

**Additional Notes:** I used ChatGPT to try and find some more relevant design theory that I could apply to my game. After googling them, however, I found most of them were inaccurate, and some didn't exist. One theory mentioned, however, was useful, and I've incorporated it into my work.
